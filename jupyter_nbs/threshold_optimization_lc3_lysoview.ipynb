    "# Workbook for optimizing foci segmentation thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook provides step-by-step instructions for determining segmentation thresholds for identifying foci within cells. __Do not edit this workbook file directly!__ Make a copy for each optimization that you perform and edit that version. Save this template in an unedited form for future experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook uses a built-in \"optimization mode\" that only pulls the first three images out of multi-image .czi files to dramatically speed up processing. This will allow you to tinker with thresholds and find the ideal cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that the most effective way to define these cutoffs was to use a positive control image - one where there were many foci - and a negative control image with few to no foci to set the thresholds. This allows you to identify cutoffs that simultaneously maximize sensitivity while minimizing false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Before running this notebook, you must have completed the setup notebook in the install folder.__"
